    //using [your-alias] = [original-type];
    //using keyword works in the EXACT same way as typedef (it actually has the same semantics [meaning])
    //using is newer, however (c++11) and can also be used with templates, so favour using
    ////template<class T> using greg = std::vector<T>; <-- this works, but a template declaration cannot appear at block scope (as must be eval at compile time), so is defined at beginning of file
