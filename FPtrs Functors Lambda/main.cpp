    //// LAMBDA

    std::cout << "\nLambda Expressions" << std::endl;


    //There are 3 parts to a lambda:
        //1: [] The capture list
        //2: () The params
        //3: {} The code

    //The most simple lambda that instantly calls itself (does nothing)
    [](){}();

    //A lambda is essentially a functor created using a fancy syntactic sugar, however when a lambda captures nothing, it evaluates to a function pointer:
    //Passing vars through the [] capture list is essentially the same as passing vars through the ctor of a functor
    useFPtr([] (std::string x) {return x + " GUVNA";});//As you may notice, the return type is deduces implicitly by the compiler
    auto lam = [=] (std::string x) {return x;}; // Simply use auto. Its very hard to deduce the complex type of a lambda. Typing is not consistent.


    //As a lambda is actually a complex functor type under the hood, it can be passed as a std::function e.g.
    double x = 5.0;
    //Automatically deduces the return type of a lambda unless you explicitly use a trailing return type (e.g. auto x = []() -> bool {...}).
    //Can capture a var in capture list. Acts much like a member variable in a functor
    long numMoreThanX = std::count_if(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(),  [x](double y){return y > x;}  ); //std::count_if uses std::function as a param. Lambdas can be passed as a std::function
    std::cout << "Number more than x(" << x << "): " << numMoreThanX << std::endl;

    //If you you use = or & first in the capture list e.g. [=](){} or [&](){}  it will capture all local symbols by value or reference
    //You can also pass all except x by value or all but y by ref e.g. [=, &x] [&, y]
    //Additionally, since a lambda is an class in itself, it does not have access to private variables, therefore, if you want to access the current objects local variables you must capture "this"
    //e.g. [this](){}  This captures member in the class by reference (as this is a pointer / location to the actual object)
    //Since you cant simultaneously catch all by value and by ref, you cant do [this, =] just as you cant do [&, =];
